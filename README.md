## General Information

The goal is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of accurately detecting melanoma, a severe form of skin cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. 
Early detection is crucial, and an automated system that analyzes skin images to alert dermatologists about potential melanoma can significantly reduce manual diagnostic efforts.

The dataset comprises 2,357 images of both malignant and benign skin conditions, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). 
The images are categorized based on ISIC classifications, with balanced distribution across most categories. However, images of melanoma and moles (nevus) are slightly more prevalent.

Disease Categories Included
Actinic Keratosis
Basal Cell Carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented Benign Keratosis
Seborrheic Keratosis
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Vascular Lesion

## Conclusions
The final model successfully addressed overfitting issues, resulting in improved accuracy.
